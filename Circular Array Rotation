/*
Here you are rotation vector in just a single loop wid the help of new array as here we are taking space O(n) bt that will be ohk,
as the question will be solved in O(n). let assume the value of k is 100000 so now if you directly rotate array than complexity will be
O(100000*n) that will be much higher.so we can use little extra space.

so here we use a little tricky logic to do so we will check k+i is greater than length than we set values is k+i-len that means it will 
store values from beginning.
